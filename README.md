# dotfiles

This is a collection of neovim, zsh, and kitty configurations. These dotfiles are how *I* like to do things, and may or may not be useful to you. I'm constantly changing these and am very much open to suggestions, so please open an issue if you have ideas!

TODO add some screenshots

## Features (main)

The following are the main reason I created my dotfiles. For an extended list of everything inside these dotfiles, see [here](#features-extended)

* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - 
* Zsh
* Kitty

## Getting Started

Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

> Warning: This is an experimental setup script, so for now I'd pull what you want from the script and run it yourself.

```
source first_time_setup.sh
```

The features marked with `TODO` will soon be added to my Github-hosted dotfiles.

* Neovim

* Fzf (TODO)
* Homebrew (TODO)
* Mac OS Setup (TODO)

## Things I'm considering or want to investigate
