# dotfiles

This is a collection of neovim, zsh, and kitty configurations. These dotfiles are how _I_ like to do things, and may or may not be useful to you. I'm constantly changing these and am very much open to suggestions, so please open an issue if you have ideas!

## Features (main)

The following are the main reason I created my dotfiles. For an extended list of everything inside these dotfiles, see [here](#features-extended)

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - A refactor of Vim with better plugin support
- [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) - Better Unix shell
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - GPU based terminal emulator

## Getting Started

First, download the following tools.

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
- [Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#quickstart)

Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

For dotfile management I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
Running the following should establish the right symlinks; you may have to
delete a few files to get it working, but instructions to do so should show up
accordingly.

```
./install
```

> Note that I think the above command works. This project is still in its
> infancy so if you encounter problems, please file an issue.
